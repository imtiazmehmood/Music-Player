## Reanimated V2

> Due to performance issues, this example has been rewritten using [React Native Reanimated V2](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated) You can check this branch for [Animated API](https://github.com/m-inan/react-native-music-app/tree/animated_api).

## Track Player
